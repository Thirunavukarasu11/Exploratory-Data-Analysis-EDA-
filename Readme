# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository

Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use Pandas for data analysis. The notebook covers various EDA techniques like data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insight generation using Python and Pandas.

## Contents

- **Introduction to Pandas**: Overview of the Pandas library and its core data structures.
- **Data Loading**: Instructions on how to load datasets using Pandas (e.g., from CSV, Excel).
- **Data Exploration**: Techniques for examining the structure and contents of a dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling missing data, duplicates, and data type conversions.
- **Data Transformation**: Using Pandas functions for data manipulation and transformations.
- **Visualization**: Plotting and visualizing data with Pandas and Matplotlib.

## How to Access
